<h3>A Little About Myself</h3>
<p>My name is Clinton or Clint if you prefer to call me that.  I am 33 about to turn 34 in a few months.  I am an easy going person and I am very open minded.  Not much really bothers me and I love many things.  I am currently going to school to become a &quot;Software Engineer&quot; which is a very new and exciting path for me.  I have always had an interest in video games and everything about them.  I eventually want to become a game programmer but as for right now I want to learn as much as I can about the different programs I will be using in my field.</p>
